1,1+1,2,2,2,"To solve the problem \(1 + 1\) and arrive at the answer \(2\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the numbers to be added**: The problem gives us two numbers, both of which are \(1\). So, we need to add \(1\) and \(1\).

2. **Understand the addition operation**: Addition is the process of combining two or more numbers to find their total. When we add \(1\) and \(1\), we are essentially combining one unit with another unit.

3. **Perform the addition**: When we combine one unit with another unit, we get two units. In mathematical terms, this is written as:
   \[
   1 + 1 = 2
   \]

4. **State the final answer**: The result of adding \(1\) and \(1\) is \(2\). Therefore, the answer is:
   \[
   \boxed{2}
   \]

This step-by-step reasoning shows that the answer to the problem \(1 + 1\) is indeed \(2\)."
